# Application Control
This is an application controller. Its main function is to allow a cleaner desktop and faster access to apps that you desire. There are also a lot of other technological companies that have made similar items, which inspired me to make one for myself as that it can be very handy when managing desktop.

The current supported operating system is windows ***only***, and will consider to expand it into a cross-platform application later on.
## Current apps
- Google Chrome
- Discord
- File Explorer
- Spotify
- Settings
- Microsoft Word
- Zoom Meeting
