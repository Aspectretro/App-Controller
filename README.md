# Application Control
This is an application controller. Its main function is to allow a cleaner desktop and faster access to apps that you desire. There are also a lot of other technological companies that have made similar items, which inspired me to make one for myself.

The current supported operating system is windows ***only***, and will consider to expand it into a cross-platform application later on.
