# Application Control
This is an application controller. Its main function is to allow a cleaner desktop and faster access to apps that you desire. There are also a lot of other technological companies that have made similar items (such as an stream deck), which inspired me to make one for myself as that it can be very handy when managing desktop applications and also allowing quick access to certain applications.

The current supported operating system is windows ***only***, and will consider to expand it into a cross-platform application later on.
